### 1. Give 2-4 key points from the SONA 2025 that you found interesting
One of the key points I found interesting was the P20 per kilo rice that they will offer without causing "losses" to farmers. The second key point that I found interesting is the revitalization of the coconut industry by planting at least 15 million hybrid and high-quality coconut seedlings this year.
### 2. Give 1-3 key points from SONA 2025 that you found weird for any reason 
I found it weird that the corruption for the budget on the flood control project was evident but nothing was done to prevent this.
### 3. Write 2 paragraphs of reflection (each paragraph is ideally around 4 sentences)
President Marcos Jr.â€™s 2025 SONA focused on economic growth, social services, and major infrastructure plans. He highlighted free healthcare, better internet, and more classrooms, but avoided controversial issues like the ICC and West Philippine Sea.

While the speech showed progress, many remain unsure if these promises will be felt in daily life. Critics called for faster action on key issues. Real change will depend on how well the government follows through.

### 4. What 1 word/ phrase/ or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025?
Don't have high expectations.
