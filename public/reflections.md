# Q1 End of Lessons Reflections

## 1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

1. **Arithmetic Operators**  
   I understand arithmetic operators in JavaScript very well because they are similar to what I have already encountered in other languages like C++. We applied them in different problems such as solving equations, finding remainders, and doing calculations in loops. Practicing them repeatedly in VSCode helped me build confidence in their use.

2. **Variables and Data Types**  
   I can easily declare variables using `let`, `const`, or `var` and know when to use each one. I also understand JavaScript data types like numbers, strings, booleans, and arrays. This topic is clear to me because we had several exercises where we needed to store and update values, and GitHub submissions made me double-check my code before committing.

3. **Conditional Statements (if/else)**  
   I know how to use if/else statements to control the flow of a program. We worked on coding tasks where we needed to test conditions, like checking if a number is even or odd, or if a grade is passing. These tasks helped me clearly see how decision-making is applied in real code.

4. **Loops (for and while)**  
   Loops are something I became confident in during this quarter. I can write `for` loops to repeat a block of code for a known number of times and `while` loops for unknown conditions. Our exercises, like printing sequences of numbers or calculating sums, made this topic very easy to understand.

5. **Functions**  
   I know how to create and use functions to make my code more organized. Functions allow me to reuse code instead of writing the same logic multiple times. We had coding tasks like writing a function to compute averages or to return the maximum number in a list, which made this concept very practical for me.

## 2. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but need further practice/discussion and why.

1. **Arrays** – I know how to declare arrays and access elements, but I need more practice with methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `splice()`, and `slice()`.  
2. **Nested Loops** – I understand the idea but sometimes get confused about the order in which the loops run.  
3. **Logical Operators** – I know how `&&`, `||`, and `!` work, but I still mix them up when combining multiple conditions.  
4. **Switch Statements** – I can describe them, but I mostly use if/else out of habit, so I need more practice writing switch cases.  
5. **Debugging in VSCode** – I know how to use `console.log()` for debugging, but I need more practice with VSCode’s built-in debugger to trace errors efficiently.

## 3. Describe your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed in the second item.

1. For **Arrays**, I will practice by solving coding challenges that involve inserting, removing, and looping through arrays.  
2. For **Nested Loops**, I will manually trace examples and write small programs like multiplication tables to get familiar with their flow.  
3. For **Logical Operators**, I will make short exercises with multiple conditions, such as eligibility checks, to apply them more often.  
4. For **Switch Statements**, I will take problems I solved with if/else and rewrite them using switch so I can compare the difference.  
5. For **Debugging in VSCode**, I will watch tutorials on breakpoints and debugging tools, then apply them while working on coding tasks instead of relying only on `## 4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think were not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why.

## 4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think were not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why.

1. **Effective Activities:**  
   - Coding tasks we submitted on GitHub were very effective because they gave me direct practice in solving problems in coding.
   - Quizzes and short assessments were also effective because they tested my understanding and showed me which topics I had mastered and which ones I still needed to review.  

2. **Not Effective Activities:**  
   - Long lectures with fewer code examples were less effective because I understand better when I am actually typing and running the code.  
   - Reading from slides without immediate exercises was not very effective because I tend to forget the details unless I apply them right away.
